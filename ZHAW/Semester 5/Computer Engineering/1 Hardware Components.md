## CPU
Central Processing Unit or processor
### Datapath
- ALU: Arithmetic and Logic Unit (performs logic and [[6 Arithmetic Operation]])
- registers (fast but limited storage inside CPU)
- hold intermediate results
### Control Unit
- Finite State Machines (reads and executes instructions)
- types of operations
	- data transfer
	- logic and [[6 Arithmetic Operation]]
	- jumps
## Memory
- Central memory, connected through System-Bus
- stores instructions (can also be in CPU) and data
- RAM (volatile) & ROM (non-volatile).
- 2^n addresses (from 0 to 2N-1)
